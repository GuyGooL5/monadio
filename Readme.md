# Monadio

Monadio is a TypeScript library that provides a set of monadic utilities inspired by Rust's extensive `Result` and `Option` enum types (and more).  
The goal of Monadio is to let you describe contorl-flow behavior and error-handling in a functional, and natural flow.

## Installation

You can install Monadio using:

`$ pnpm add monadio`  
`$ bun install monadio`  
`$ yarn add monadio`  
`$ npm install monadio`
